# Chris's Field Trip Examples

## Overview

This is a set of documentation and sample code intended to guide new users
through reading and processing our lab's data using Field Trip.

Some of this is done using Field Trip's code, and some of this is done
using my library code.

## Getting Started

Field Trip is a set of libraries that reads ephys data and performs signal
processing and various statistical analyses on it. It's a framework that
you can use to build your own analysis scripts.

To get Field Trip:
* Check that you have the Matlab toolboxes you'll need:
    * Signal Processing Toolbox (mandatory)
    * Statistics Toolbox (mandatory)
    * Optimization Toolbox (optional; needed for fitting dipoles)
    * Image Processing Toolbox (optional; needed for MRI)
* Go to [fieldtriptoolbox.org](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org).
* Click "latest release" in the sidebar on the top right
(or click [here](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/#latest-release)).
* Look for "FieldTrip version (link) has been released". Follow that
GitHub link (example: 
[Nov. 2021 link](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20211118)).
* Unpack the archive somewhere appropriate, and add that directory to
Matlab's search path.
