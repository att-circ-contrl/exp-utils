Signals extracted by euChris_extractSignals_XXX are stored in a structure,
with fields depending on experiment type.


For experiments of type 'loop2302', fields are as follows:

NOTE - Wideband and signals derived from it should always exist, but
other fields aren't gauranteed to be present.

"wb_time" and "wb_wave" are the wideband signal.
"lfp_time" and "lfp_wave" are the wide-cut LFP signal.
"band_time" and "band_wave" are the ideal (acausal) narrow-band signal.
"delayband_time" and "delayband_wave" are a version of the narrow-band
  signal produced with a causal filter. This won't match TORTE's filter.

"canon_time", "canon_mag", "canon_phase", and "canon_rms" are derived
  from the acausal band-pass signal. These are the time, analytic
  magnitude and phase, and the acausal moving RMS average of the
  magnitude, respectively.
"delayed_time", "delayed_mag", "delayed_phase", and "delayed_rms"
  are derived from the delayed (causal) band-pass signal. These are the
  time, analytic magnitude and phase, and delayed (causal) moving RMS
  average of the magnitude, respectively.
"canon_magflag", "canon_phaseflag", "delayed_magflag", and
  "delayed_phaseflag" are the magnitude excursion detection flag and
  the phase target match flag derived from the acausal and delayed
  (causal) signals described above.
"canon_magflag_edges", "canon_phaseflag_edges", "delayed_magflag_edges",
  and "delayed_phaseflag_edges" are vectors holding timestamps of rising
  edges of the corresponding magnitude detection flags and of the
  delayed phase detection flag, and timestamps of the high pulse
  midpoints of the acausal phase detection flag.

"torte_time", "torte_mag", and "torte_phase" are the recorded values
  of the TNE Lab Phase Calculator plugin's estimates of instantaneous
  magnitude and instantaneous phase.
  NOTE - These signals are not guaranteed to exist!
"torte_wave" is a reconstruction of the narrow-band signal using
  "torte_mag" and "torte_phase". This should look like "delayband_wave".

"XXX_ftevents", "XXX_wave", "XXX_time", and "XXX_edges" are stored for
  each of several TTL signals.
  NOTE - These signals are not guaranteed to exist!
  "XXX_ftevents" holds a Field Trip event structure array for events
    associated with this TTL signal, per ft_read_event().
  "XXX_wave" is a logical vector holding time-series waveform data for
    this TTL signal.
  "XXX_time" is a vector holding waveform timestamp data for this signal.
  "XXX_edges" is a vector holding timestamps of rising signal edges.
  Signals saved (values of "XXX") are "loopback", "detectmag",
  "detectphase", "detectrand", "trigphase", "trigrand", "trigpower",
  "trigimmed", and "trigused" (a duplicate of one of the other "trig"
  signals).
