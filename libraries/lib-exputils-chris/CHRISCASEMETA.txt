The "euHLev_getChrisMetadata()" function accepts "case" definition
structures as arguments; these are described below. The returned metadata
structures (per CHRISEXPMETA.txt) are augmented with these case definitions.


Case definition structures have the following fields:

"folder" is the path to extract experiment metadata from.
"prefix" is a character vector with a filename-safe prefix to use with plots.
"title" is a character vector with a human-readable description to use in
  plots.
"setprefix" is a character vector with a filename-safe prefix to use with
  plots for the group of cases of which this case is a part.
"settitle" is a character vector with a human-readable description to use
  in plots for the group of cases of which this case is a part.
"exptype" is a character vector defining the type of dataset being processed
  (e.g. 'loop2302').
"hint" is a structure containing hints for parsing and/or data processing.
  This may be a structure with no fields or an empty structure array.


Hint fields recognized by library functions are as follows:

"extrachans" is a cell array containing Field Trip channel labels of
  additional channels to plot.
"extrachanprefixes" is a cell array with filename-safe prefixes to use when
  plotting data derived from the channels listed in "extrachans".
"extrachantitles" is a cell array with human-readable titles to use when
  plotting data derived from the channels listed in "extrachans".

"chanbatches" is a cell array defining groups of channels to process. Each
  group is stored as four successive entries in "chanbatches": a
  filename-safe label, a human-readable title, a sprintf pattern for
  channel names that contains a channel number pattern, and a vector
  containing channel numbers to iterate through.
