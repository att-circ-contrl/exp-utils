The "euHLev_getChrisMetadata()" function accepts "case" definition
structures as arguments and augments the returned metadata structures with
them (per CHRISEXPMETA.txt).


Case definition structures have the following fields:

"folder" is the path to extract experiment metadata from.
"prefix" is a character vector with a filename-safe prefix to use with plots.
"title" is a character vector with a human-readable description to use in
  plots.
"setprefix" is a character vector with a filename-safe prefix to use with
  plots for the group of cases of which this case is a part.
"settitle" is a character vector with a human-readable description to use
  in plots for the group of cases of which this case is a part.
"exptype" is a character vector defining the type of dataset being processed
  (e.g. 'loop2302').
"hint" is a structure containing hints for parsing and/or data processing.
  This may be a structure with no fields or an empty structure array.


Hint fields recognized by library functions are as follows:

(No library-recognized hints yet.)
