Oscillation fit parameters are stored as a structure with the following
fields:


Fields relating to finding the global dominant oscillation frequency:

"window_search" [ min max ] is a time range (in seconds) to look at when
  measuring the dominant oscillation frequency.

"freq_search" [ min max ] is the frequency range to search for the
  dominant oscillation frequency.

"freq_drift" [ min max ] is the minimum and maximum multiple of the
  dominant frequency to accept when curve-fitting in time windows.
  E.g. [ 0.5 1.5 ] accepts from 0.5 * fdominant to 1.5 * fdominant.


Fields relating to measuring local oscillations within specific windows:

"min_before_strength" is the minimum oscillation magnitude a channel
  has to have, as a fraction of the strongest channel's magnitude, to
  be considered to be oscillating before stimulation.

"window_lambda" is the width of the curve-fitting time window, as a
  multiple of the dominant oscillation wavelength.

"time_before" is the desired timestamp (in seconds) of the middle of the
  before-stimulation curve-fitting window.

"timelist_after" is a vector containing desired timestamps (in seconds) of
  the middle of after-stimulation curve fitting windows.


Debugging fields:

"use_line_fit" (optional) is true to subtract a line fit before performing
  a cosine fit, and false or absent to just subtract the mean.

"debug_save_waves" (optional) is true to save the waveforms being curve
  fit into the results data structure, and false or absent to discard them.
