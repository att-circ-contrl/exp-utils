Multi-unit activity features are stored as a structure with the following
fields. Time window information is not stored in this structure; it was
provided by a MUA analysis parameter structure, per CHRISMUAPARAMS.txt.

Each response describes one trial (or one timelock-average from a set of
trials); responses for multiple trials are typically returned as a cell
array of per-trial responses.



Metadata:

"trialnum" is the trial number.



Raw statistics:

"meanbefore" is a Nchans x 1 vector holding the mean of the MUA before
  stimulation.

"meanafter_list" is a Nchans x Nwindows matrix containing means of the MUA
  after stimulation.

"devbefore" is a Nchans x 1 vector holding the standard deviation of the
  MUA before stimulation.

"devafter_list" is a Nchans x Nwindows matrix containing standard deviations
  of the MUA after stimulation.



Derived statistics:

"basemult_list" is a Nchans x Nwindows matrix containing
  meanafter / meanbefore. This is the relative increase in background
  activity.

"devmult_list" is a Nchans x Nwidnows matrix containing
  devafter / devbefore. This is the relative increase in activity
  _variability_.

"zbaseshift_list" is a Nchans x Nwindows matrix containing
  (meanafter - meanbefore) / devbefore. This is the z-scored _displacement_
  in background activity.


If noise is negligible and spiking activity is the dominant component of
the background, then "basemult" is a z-scored measure of activity change.

If noise is the dominant component of the background and real spiking
activity is intermittent, "devmult" is a z-scored measure of activity change.

If the noise component of the background is the same before and after
stimulation, and if spiking activity is a significant component of the
background, then "zbaseshift" is a z-scored measure of activity change.
