Multi-unit activity analysis parameters are stored as a structure with the
following fields:


Common to most functions:

"time_window_ms" is the duration in milliseconds of the time windows used
  for extracting average statistics.

"timelist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the analysis time windows should be.



Used by euChris_extractStimMUAResponse:

"time_before_ms" is a timestamp in milliseconds specifying where the middle
  of the "before stimulation" time window should be.



Used by euChris_calcXCorr:

"xcorr_range_ms" [ min max ] is the range of values in milliseconds to use
  for time lag when performing cross-correlation.

"xcorr_norm_method" is a character vector containing the normalization
  method to pass to "xcorr". This is typically 'unbiased' (to normalize by
  sample count) or 'coeff' (to normalize so that self-correlation is 1).
