Multi-unit activity analysis parameters are stored as a structure with the
following fields:


Common to most functions:

"time_window_ms" is the duration in milliseconds of the time windows used
  for extracting average statistics.

"time_before_ms" is a timestamp in milliseconds specifying where the middle
  of the "before stimulation" time window should be.

"timelist_after_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the middle of the "after stimulation" time windows
  should be.


Used by (FIXME - Cross-correlation is not yet a library function):

"xcorr_range_ms" [ min max ] is the range of values in milliseconds to use
  for time lag when performing cross-correlation.

"xcorr_norm_method" is a character vector containing the normalization
  method to pass to "xcorr". This is typically 'unbiased' or 'coeff'.
