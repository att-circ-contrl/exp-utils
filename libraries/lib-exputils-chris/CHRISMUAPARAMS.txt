Multi-unit activity analysis parameters are stored as a structure with the
following fields:


"time_window_ms" is the duration in milliseconds of the time windows used
  for extracting average statistics.

"time_before_ms" is a timestamp in milliseconds specifying where the middle
  of the "before stimulation" time window should be.

"timelist_after_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the middle of the "after stimulation" time windows
  should be.
