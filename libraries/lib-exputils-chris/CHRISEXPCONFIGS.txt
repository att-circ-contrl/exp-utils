High-level experiment configuration is stored as a structure, with fields
depending on the experiment type.


For experiments of type 'loop2302', fields are as follows:

"chan_wb_num" is the Open Ephys channel number of the wideband signal.
"chan_mag_num" is the Open Ephys channel number with the analytic magnitude.
"chan_phase_num" is the Open Ephys channel number with the analytic phase.

"chan_wb_oelabel" is the Open Ephys name of the wideband channel.

"trigtype" is 'phase', 'random', 'power', 'immediate', or 'none'. This
  indicates how the Arduino output, if any, was generated.

"file_node_first" is the Record Node node number of the primary file writing
  node (saving wideband data and the loopback trigger signal).
"file_node_second" is the Record Node node number of the secondary file
  writing node (saving derived and internally generated signals), or NaN if
  this node wasn't present.


(Signals saved by the primary file writing node:)

"chan_wb_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved wideband signal,
  or '' if this wasn't saved.

"chan_ttl_loopback_trig_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved
  stimulation trigger TTL signal as read back by the Intan recorder,
  or '' if this wasn't saved.


(Signals saved by the secondary file writing node:)

"chan_mag_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved magnitude signal,
  or '' if this wasn't saved.
"chan_phase_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved phase signal,
  or '' if this wasn't saved.

"chan_ttl_detect_mag_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved magnitude
  detection TTL signal, or '' if this wasn't saved.
"chan_ttl_detect_phase_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved
  desired-phase detection TTL signal, or '' if this wasn't saved.
"chan_ttl_detect_rand_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved
  random-phase detection TTL signal, or '' if this wasn't saved.

"chan_ttl_trig_phase_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved stimulation
  trigger TTL signal for fixed-phase stimulation, or '' if this wasn't saved.
"chan_ttl_trig_rand_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved stimulation
  trigger TTL signal for random-phase stimulation, or '' if this wasn't saved.
"chan_ttl_trig_power_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved stimulation
  trigger TTL signal for magnitude excursion stimulation, or '' if this wasn't
  saved.
"chan_ttl_trig_immed_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved stimulation
  trigger TTL signal for immediate stimulation, or '' if this wasn't saved.

"chan_ttl_trig_selected_ftlabel" is the Field Trip name of the saved
  stimulation trigger TTL signal that was actually sent to the stimulator.
