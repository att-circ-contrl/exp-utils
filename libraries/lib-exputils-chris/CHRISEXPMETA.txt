The "euChris_parseExperimentConfig()" function returns metadata structures
describing the configuration of experiments that used Chris's signal chains.
The contents of these metadata structures is described below.



Fields common to all types of metadata structure:

"summary" is a cell array of character vectors containing a short
  human-readable summary of the experiment configuration.
"details" is a cell array of character vectors containing a human-readable
  detailed description of the experiment config.

"diagmsgs" is a cell array containing diagnostic messages _and_ error and
  warning messages generated during processing.
"errmsgs" is a cell array containing _only_ error and warning messages
  generated during processing.

"rawmetalist" is a copy of the "rawmetalist" cell array passed to
  "euChris_parseExperimentConfig()". This contains metadata structures
  returned by euHLev_getAllMetadata_XXX, per RAWFOLDERMETA.txt.

"exptype" is a label defining the type of signal chain used; e.g. 'loop2023'.
"hintdata" is a structure containing hints for processing metadata. If there
  are no hints, this will be a structure with no fields.

"cookedmeta" is a structure containing type-specific derived metadata, per
  CHRISCOOKEDMETA.txt.

"expconfig" is a structure describing the experiment configuration, per
  CHRISEXPCONFIGS.txt.
