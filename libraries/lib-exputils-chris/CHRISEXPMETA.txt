The "euChris_parseExperimentConfig()" function returns metadata structures
describing the configuration of experiments that used Chris's signal chains.
The contents of these metadata structures is described below.



Fields common to all types of metadata structure:

"summary" is a human-readable short summary of the experiment configuration.
"details" is a human-readable detailed description of the experiment config.

"diagmsgs" is a cell array containing diagnostic messages _and_ error and
  warning messages generated during processing.
"errmsgs" is a cell array containing _only_ error and warning messages
  generated during processing.

"rawmetalist" is a copy of the "rawmetalist" cell array passed to
  "euChris_parseExperimentConfig()". This contains metadata structures
  returned by euHLev_getAllMetadata_XXX, per RAWFOLDERMETA.txt.

"exptype" is a label defining the type of signal chain used; e.g. 'loop2023'.
"hintdata" is a structure containing hints for processing metadata. If there
  are no hints, this will be a structure with no fields.

"cookedmeta" is a structure containing type-specific derived metadata.
  Fields are described below.



Fields specific to 'loop2302' type metadata:

Fields in "cookedmeta" (NaN or empty vectors/arrays if undefined):

  "samprate" is the acquisition sampling rate.

  "torteband" [ low high ] has the Phase Calculator's band corners.
  "torteinchan" is the channel number of the Phase Calculator's input.

  "crossmagchan" is the channel number of the magnitude detector's input.
  "crossmagthresh" is the multiplier used to get the magnitude threshold
    from the RMS average magnitude.
  "crossmagtau" is the decay time in seconds for computing this RMS average.
  "crossmagbank" is the bank index (0-based) of the detector's TTL output.
  "crossmagbit" is the bit number (0-based) of the detector's TTL output.

  "crossphasechan" is the channel number of the phase detector's input.
  "crossphaseval" is the target value (phase threshold) for the detector.
  "crossphasebank" is the bank index (0-based) of the detector's TTL output.
  "crossphasebit" is the bit number (0-based) of the detector's TTL output.

  "crossrandchan" is the channel number of the random phase comparator's
    input.
  "crossrandbank" is the bank index (0-based) of the detector's TTL output.
  "crossrandbit" is the bit number (0-based) of the detector's TTL output.

  "randwasjitter" is true if the conditional trigger faked random phase
    targets by adding jitter to a fixed phase target.

  "trigbank" is the bank index (0-based) of the conditional trigger's TTL
    outputs.
  "trigphasebit" is the bit index (0-based) of the phase-aligned trigger
    output.
  "trigrandbit" is the bit index (0-based) of the random-phase trigger
    output.
  "trigmagbit" is the bit index (0-based) of the power excursion trigger
    output.
  "trignowbit" is the bit index (0-based) of the "trigger immediately when
    RwdB goes high" trigger output.

  "ardinbit" is the bit index (0-based) of the Arduino's triggering input.


FIXME - Need channel labels and maybe map and file output channel lists.

FIXME - Convert channel numbers to labels? Or keep as channel numbers?

FIXME - NYI.
