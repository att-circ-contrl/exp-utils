The "euChris_parseExperimentConfig()" function returns metadata structures
describing the configuration of experiments that used Chris's signal chains.
The contents of these metadata structures is described below.



Fields common to all types of metadata structure:

"summary" is a human-readable short summary of the experiment configuration.
"details" is a human-readable detailed description of the experiment config.

"diagmsgs" is a cell array containing diagnostic messages _and_ error and
  warning messages generated during processing.
"errmsgs" is a cell array containing _only_ error and warning messages
  generated during processing.

"rawmetalist" is a copy of the "rawmetalist" structure array passed to
  "euChris_parseExperimentConfig()". It contains the following fields:
  "folder" is the data folder (containing structure.oebin, *.rhd, etc).
  "header_ft" is the Field Trip header read from this folder.
  "chans_an"  is a cell array containing ephys analog channel names.
  "chans_dig" is a cell array containing digital TTL channel names.
  "settings" is a structure containing native configuration information
    (such as the XML parse of Open Ephys's "settings.xml").
  "type" is 'openephys', 'intanrec', or 'intanstim'.

"exptype" is a label defining the type of signal chain used; e.g. 'loop2023'.
"hintdata" is a structure containing hints for processing metadata. If there
  are no hints, this will be a structure with no fields.



Fields specific to 'loop2302' type metadata:
