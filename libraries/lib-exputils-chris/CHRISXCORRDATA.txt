A raw cross-correlation data structure is a structure with the following
fields:


"firstchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the first set of
  channels being compared.
"secondchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the second set of
  channels being compared.

"delaylist_ms" is a vector containing the time lags tested in milliseconds.

"windowlist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the middle of each cross-correlation window is.

"xcorravg" is a matrix indexed by (firstchan, secondchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the cross-correlation values, averaged across trials.
"xcorrcount" is a matrix indexed by (firstchan, secondchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the number of trials used to produce the averages in xcorravg.
"xcorrvar" is a matrix indexed by (firstchan, secondchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the variance of the cross-correlation values used to produce
  the averages in xcorravg.
