A "batch definition" describes a list of channels to be processed.

This is either a cell array or a character vector.

If it's a cell array, it contains a list of names of channels to be read.

If it's a character vector, it's one of the following:

  'trig' indicates the trigger channel from the experiment.
  'hint' indicates the channels listed in the "extrachans" hint field.
  'all' indicates that all channels are to be read.

(This is the end of the file.)
