Stimulation response data is a structure containing the following fields.
This can be used for alignment from any type of event, not just stimulation:


"ftdata_wb" is a Field Trip data structure containing the wideband data
  after artifact rejection and notch filtering, segmented into trials
  triggered by stimulation events.
"ftdata_lfp" (optional) is a Field Trip data structure containing broad-band
  LFP data, segmented into trials triggered by stimulation events.
"ftdata_band" (optional) is a Field Trip data structure containing narrow-band
  LFP data, segmented into trials triggered by stimulation events.

"tortecidx" is the index of the TORTE input channel in ftdata_XXX.
"extracidx" is a vector with indices of the hint-specified extra channels
  in ftdata_XXX.

"trainpos" is a vector with one entry per trial, holding the relative
  position of each trial in its associated event train (1 for the first
  event of a train, 2 for the next, and so forth).
"trainlast" is a logical vector with one entry per trial, which is true for
  trials that are the last event in a train.
