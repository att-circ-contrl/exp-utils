A signal configuration structure is used by several of the
"euChris_extractXXXX" functions. This structure has the following fields:


Common:

"notch_freqs" is a vector of frequencies to notch filter (may be empty).
"notch_bandwidth" is the bandwidth of the notch filter.
"head_tail_trim_fraction" is the relative amount to trim from the head
  and tail of the data (as a fraction of the total length). This should be
  in the range of 0 to 0.5.

"artifact_suppression_level" is used to tune magnitude and derivative based
  artifact suppression. A value of 0 uses default thresholds; positive
  values have more suppression, negative values less, NaN disables.

"lfp_band" [ min max ] is the broad-band LFP frequency range.



For euChris_extractSignals_loop2302:

"canon_detect_phase_width_degrees" is the width of the response window
  to use when estimating what the phase detector signal should look like.



For euChris_extractStimResponses_loop2302:

"event_squash_window_ms" [ start stop ] is the window around stimulation
  to replace with NaN, in milliseconds. E.g. [ -0.5 1.5 ]. If this is [],
  no squashing is performed.

"exp_fit_starts_ms" is a vector containing exponential curve fit start times
  (relative to the stimulation trigger) for stimulation artifact removal. If
  this is empty, no curve fits are performed.

"exp_fit_method" is a character vector or cell array specifying the
  algorithm to use for curve fitting all segments (if a character vector)
  or for each segment individually (if a cell array of character vectors).
  If omitted or '', a default algorithm is used.

"want_step_removal" is true to apply a ramp to remove any step artifact
  introduced by stimulation, false otherwise. This requires a squash window.
