A signal configuration structure is used by several of the
"euChris_extractXXXX" functions. This structure has the following fields:


Common:

"notch_freqs" is a vector of frequencies to notch filter (may be empty).
"notch_bandwidth" is the bandwidth of the notch filter.
"head_tail_trim_fraction" is the relative amount to trim from the head
  and tail of the data (as a fraction of the total length). This should be
  in the range of 0 to 0.5.

"artifact_suppression_level" is used to tune magnitude and derivative based
  artifact suppression. A value of 0 uses default thresholds; positive
  values have more suppression, negative values less, NaN disables.

"lfp_band" [ min max ] is the broad-band LFP frequency range.



For euChris_extractSignals_loop2302:

"canon_detect_phase_width_degrees" is the width of the response window
  to use when estimating what the phase detector signal should look like.
