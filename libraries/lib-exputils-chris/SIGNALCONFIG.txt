A signal configuration structure is used by several of the
"euChris_extractXXXX" functions. This structure has the following fields:


Common:

"notch_freqs" is a vector of frequencies to notch filter (may be empty).
"notch_bandwidth" is the bandwidth of the notch filter.

"lfp_band" [ min max ] is the broad-band LFP frequency range.

"artifact_method" is a character vector specifying the artifact suppression
  method (per ARTIFACTCONFIG.txt).

"artparams_sigma", if present, is a configuration structure for standard
  deviation based artifact rejection, per ARTIFACTCONFIG.txt.

"artparams_expknown", if present, is a configuration structure for artifact
  rejection using exponential curve fits at known locations, per
  ARTIFACTCONFIG.txt.

"artparams_expguess", if present, is a configuration structure for artifact
  rejection using exponential curve fits at guessed locations, per
  ARTIFACTCONFIG.txt.



For euChris_extractSignalsAnalog_loop2302:

"head_tail_trim_fraction" is the relative amount to trim from the head
  and tail of the data (as a fraction of the total length). This should be
  in the range of 0 to 0.5.
"canon_detect_phase_width_degrees" is the width of the response window
  to use when estimating what the phase detector signal should look like.



For euChris_extractStimResponses_loop2302:

Artifact suppression can be specified for this function.
