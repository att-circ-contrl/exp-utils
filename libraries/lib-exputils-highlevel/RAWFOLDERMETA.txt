Folder metadata as returned by euHLev_getAllMetadata_XXX is encapsulated as
a structure with the fields described below.


Common to all folder types:

"folder" is the folder path (as returned by euUtil_getExperimentFolders()).
"type" is 'openephys', 'intanrec', or 'intanstim'.

"header_ft" is the Field Trip header structure for this folder.
"chans_an" is a cell array containing analog channel FT labels.
"chans_dig" is a cell array containing digital channel FT labels.

"chanmap_raw" is a cell array with FT channel names before mapping.
"chanmap_cooked" is a cell array with FT channel names after mapping.

...The channel map is a "best guess", and might not be defined if the
helper function couldn't find appropriate configuration files.


Fields for type 'openephys' (Open Ephys v0.5):

"settings" is a copy of the XML parse of "settings.xml", as returned by
  readstruct().
"oebufinfo" is Open Ephys buffer metadata as returned by
  nlOpenE_parseConfigAudioBufferInfo_v5().
"oesigchain" is a cell array containing metadata for all processor nodes
  found by nlOpenE_parseConfigProcessorsXML_v5().
