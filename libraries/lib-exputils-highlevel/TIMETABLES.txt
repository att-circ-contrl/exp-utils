A time alignment structure ("time tables structure") is a structure
containing several time alignment tables, used by high-level time alignment
functions.

Each table contains timestamp tuples showing corresponding times between
two or more devices.

The following tables are present (as empty tables if time alignment couldn't
be performed for the associated devices):

  "record_synchbox" associates 'synchBoxTime' and 'recTime'.
  "record_game" associates 'unityTime' and 'recTime'.
  "record_stim" associates 'recTime' and 'stimTime'.
  "game_eye" associates 'unityTime' and 'eyeTime'.
