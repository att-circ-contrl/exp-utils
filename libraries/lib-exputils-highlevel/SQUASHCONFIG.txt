Artifact squashing, step correction, and interpolation are specified using
a configuration structure with the following fields:


"squash_window_ms" [ start stop ] is a window around t=0 to replace with
  NaN, in milliseconds (e.g. [ -0.5 1.5 ]). If this is [] or absent, no
  squashing is performed.

"auto_squash_threshold" is the amount by which the signal must depart
  from the DC level to be automatically squashed as a residual artifact,
  if adjacent to an existing NaN span. This is a multiple of
  the median-to-quartile distance (about two thirds of a standard
  deviation). Typical values are 6-12 for clear exponential excursions.
  If this is absent or Inf or NaN, no squashing is performed.

"ramp_span_ms" [ start stop ] is a duration around t=0 to apply a ramp to
  remove any DC step present over NaN regions (squashed regions). This
  If this is [] or absent, no ramping is performed.

"want_interp" is true to interpolate within squashed regions, false or
  absent to leave NaN regions in place.
