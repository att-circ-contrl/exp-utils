The "euHLev_getBasisDecomposition" function decomposes a set of signals into
the weighted sums of a set of basis vectors, plus a background. This file
describes how data and basis vectors are stored by this function and related
functions.


A dataset is a Nvectors x Ntimesamples matrix of sample vectors. For ephys
data, this is typically Nchans x Ntimesamples.


A basis decomposition is stored as a structure with the following fields:

"basisvecs" is a Nbasis x Ntimesamples matrix where each row is a basis
  vector.
"coeffs" is a Nvectors x Nbasis matrix with basis vector weights for each
  input vector. (coeffs * basisvecs) is an estimate of (dataset).
"background" is a 1 x Ntimesamples vector containing a constant background
  to be added to all vectors during reconstruction. This is typically, but
  not always, either zero or the mean across sample vectors.
