Artifact removal is specified using a method label and a configuration
structure.



Method labels are character vectors with the following values:

'' or 'none' specifies no artifact suppression.

'sigma' specifies standard deviation based artifact rejection, per
  nlProc_removeArtifactsSigma.

'expknown' specifies exponential curve fits across known time ranges,
  per nlArt_removeMultipleExpDecays.

'expguess' specifies multiple exponential curve fits guessing at locations,
  per nlArt_removeExpDecaysByGuessing.



Standard deviation based artifact rejection configuration is a structure with
the following fields:

"threshold_adjust" is a scalar added to the default threshold levels. A
  positive value raises the absolute and derivative thresholds by the
  specified number of standard deviations, and a negative value lowers them.



Exponential fits with known locations are configured using a structure with
the following fields:

"squash_window_ms" [ start stop ] is a window around t=0 to replace with
  NaN, in milliseconds (e.g. [ -0.5 1.5 ]). If this is [], no squashing is
  performed.

"fit_fenceposts_ms" is a vector containing times to be used as span endpoints
  for exponential curve fitting. The span between the last two times is curve
  fit and its contribution subtracted, then the next-last span, and so forth.
  If this is [], no curve fits are performed.

"fit_method" is a character vector or cell array specifying the algorithms
  to use for curve fitting all segments (if a cahracter vector) or for
  each segment individually (if a cell array of character vectors). If this
  is '' or absent, a default algorithm is used.

"want_step_removal" is true to apply a ramp to remove any DC step present
  over the squash window, false otherwise. This requires a squash window.



Exponential fits with guessed locations are configured using a structure
with the fields described in EXPGUESSCONFIG.txt (from lib-nloop-artifact),
plus the following additional fields:

"plot_config" is a debug plot/report configuration structure per
  EXPGUESSPLOT.txt.


FIXME - Move these somewhere?

"tattle_verbosity" is 'quiet', 'terse', 'normal', or 'verbose'. This
  controls how many debugging/progress messages are sent to the console.

"save_verbosity" is 'quiet', 'terse', 'normal', or 'verbose'. This
  controls how many debugging/progress messages are written to log files.

"shortlabel" is a short plot-safe human-readable prefix to use when
  reporting state in log files and progress messages.

"want_debug_plots" is true to emit debugging plots of curve fits, and false
  to suppress plots.
"want_reports" is true to save summarized reports of curve fits, and false
  to suppress plots.
