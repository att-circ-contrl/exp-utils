Artifact removal is specified using a method label and a configuration
structure.



Method labels are character vectors with the following values:

'' or 'none' specifies no artifact suppression.

'sigma' specifies standard deviation based artifact rejection, per
  nlProc_removeArtifactsSigma.

'expknown' specifies exponential curve fits across known time ranges,
  per nlArt_removeMultipleExpDecays.

'expguess' specifies multiple exponential curve fits guessing at locations,
  per nlArt_removeExpDecaysByGuessing.



Standard deviation based artifact rejection configuration is a structure with
the following fields:

"threshold_adjust" is a scalar added to the default threshold levels. A
  positive value raises the absolute and derivative thresholds by the
  specified number of standard deviations, and a negative value lowers them.



Exponential fits with known locations are configured using a structure with
the following fields:

"squash_window_ms" [ start stop ] is a window around t=0 to replace with
  NaN, in milliseconds (e.g. [ -0.5 1.5 ]). If this is [], no squashing is
  performed.

"ramp_span_ms" [ start stop ] is a duration around t=0 to apply a ramp to
  remove any DC step present over the squash window. This requires a
  squash window. If this is [], no ramping is performed.

"fit_fenceposts_ms" is a vector containing times to be used as span endpoints
  for exponential curve fitting. The span between the last two times is curve
  fit and its contribution subtracted, then the next-last span, and so forth.
  If this is [], no curve fits are performed.

"fit_method" is a character vector or cell array specifying the algorithms
  to use for curve fitting all segments (if a cahracter vector) or for
  each segment individually (if a cell array of character vectors). If this
  is '' or absent, a default algorithm is used.



Exponential fits with guessed locations are configured using a structure
with the fields described in EXPGUESSCONFIG.txt (from lib-nloop-artifact),
plus the following additional fields:

"plot_config" is a debug plot/report configuration structure per
  EXPGUESSPLOT.txt, with the following additional fields:

  "want_debug_plots" is true to emit debugging plots of curve fits, and false
    to suppress plots.

  "want_reports" is true to save summarized reports of curve fits, and false
    to suppress plots.

  "tattle_verbosity" is 'quiet', 'terse', 'normal', or 'verbose'. This
    controls how many debugging/progress messages are sent to the console.

  "report_verbosity" is 'quiet', 'terse', 'normal', or 'verbose'. This
    controls how many debugging/progress messages are written to log files.

"squash_config" is a configuration structure with the following fields:

  "squash_window_ms" [ start stop ] is a window around t=0 to replace with
    NaN, in milliseconds (e.g. [ -0.5 1.5 ]). If this is [], no squashing
    is performed.

  "auto_squash_threshold" is the amount by which the signal must depart
    from the DC level to be automatically squashed as a residual artifact.
    This is a multiple of the median-to-quartile distance (about two thirds
    of a standard deviation). Typical values are 6-12 for clear exponential
    excursions. Use Inf or NaN to not squash.

  "ramp_span_ms" [ start stop ] is a duration around t=0 to apply a ramp to
    remove any DC step present over NaN regions (squashed regions). This
    If this is [], no ramping is performed.

  "want_interp" is true to interpolate within squashed regions.
