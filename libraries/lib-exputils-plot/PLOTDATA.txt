Data for plotting using euPlot_hlevPlotData is stored as a cell array of
structures, each holding a data record. These records have the following
fields:


General metadata:


"sessionlabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for
  the recording session (e.g. '20230808a'). These don't get aggregated.

"caselabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for a
  group of trials that are to be aggregated (typically corresponding to one
  set of test conditions; e.g. 'be150rand').

"probelabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for the
  group of channels in this data record (typically corresponding to one
  probe; e.g. 'pr1acc').


"sessiontitle" is a character vector containing a plot-safe human-readable
  title for the recording session (per above).

"casetitle" is a character vector containing a plot-safe human-readable
  title for the set of experiment conditions used (per above).

"probetitle" is a character vector containing a plot-safe human-readable
  title for the group of channels in this data record (per above).


"trialnum" is the trial number.

"chanlabels" is a cell array containing Field Trip channel labels for each
  of the channels in this data record.


"timelabels" is a cell array holding character vectors containing
  filename-safe labels for each of the time bins used in the data record.

"timetitles" is a cell array holding character vectors containing plot-safe
  human-readable titles for each of the time bins used in the data record.



Data fields:


Data fields have arbitrary names; multiple data fields may be present.

Time-binned data is stored in Nchans x Nbins matrices.

Data that is not time-binned is stored in Nchans x 1 matrices.
