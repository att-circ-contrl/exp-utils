Cooked data for plotting using euPlot_hlevPlotStatData_XXX is stored as a
structure array, with each element holding a data record for one curve.
This is typically derived from raw plot data (per PLOTDATARAW.txt).

The intention with using a structure array is to allow masking based on the
contents of the session, case, probe, and time label fields, or on FT trial
number.


These records have the following fields:


"sessionlabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for
  the recording session (e.g. '20230808a').

"caselabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for a
  group of trials (typically corresponding to one set of test conditions;
  e.g. 'be150rand').

"probelabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for the
  group of channels in this data record (typically corresponding to one
  probe; e.g. 'pr1acc').

"timelabel" is a character vector containing a filename-safe label for the
  time bin (e.g. 'p0100ms'). NOTE - This will be '' for data that isn't
  time-binned.


"dataseriesx" is a Npoints x 1 matrix containing data values, or a
  Npoints x 1 cell array containing label values. This is the independent
  variable (often but not always shown on the X axis).

"dataseriesy" is a Npoints x 1 matrix containing data values, or a
  Npoints x 1 cell array containing label values. This is the dependent
  variable (often but not always shown on the Y axis).
