A time window and time lag analysis generates a results data structure with
the following fields:


Metadata fields:

"destchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  destination channels being compared.
"srcchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  source channels being compared.

"delaylist_ms" is a vector containing the time lags tested in milliseconds.

"windowlist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the middle of each analysis time window is.
"windowsize_ms" is a scalar holding the duration of the analysis time windows.


Analysis results:


If averaging across trials was requested, then for each analysis result
variable "FOO", the following fields will exist:

"FOOavg" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the values of FOO, averaged across trials.
"FOOcount" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the number of trials used to produce the averages in FOOavg.
"FOOvar" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the variance of the values used to produce the averages in
  FOOavg.


If per-trial data was requested, then for each analysis result variable
"FOO", the following field will exist:

"FOOtrials" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, trialidx, winidx,
  lagidx) containing the computed values of FOO.

If an acceptance filter was used, cells of FOOtrials that were not accepted
contain NaN.


If concatenating or aggregating trials was requested, then for each analysis
result variable "FOO", the following field will exist:

"FOOsingle" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the values of FOO for aggregated or concatenated trials.
