A time window and time lag analysis generates a results data structure with
the following fields:


Metadata fields:

"firstchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the first set of
  channels being compared.
"secondchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the second set of
  channels being compared.

"delaylist_ms" is a vector containing the time lags tested in milliseconds.

"windowlist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the middle of each analysis time window is.
"windowsize_ms" is a scalar holding the duration of the analysis time windows.


Analysis results:

If averaging across trials was requested, then for each analysis result
variable "FOO", the following fields will exist:

"FOOavg" is a matrix indexed by (firstchan, secondchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the values of FOO, averaged across trials.
"FOOcount" is a matrix indexed by (firstchan, secondchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the number of trials used to produce the averages in FOOavg.
"FOOvar" is a matrix indexed by (firstchan, secondchan, winidx, lagidx)
  containing the variance of the values used to produce the averages in
  FOOavg.

If per-trial data was requested, then for each analysis result variable
"FOO", the following field will exist:

"FOOtrials" is a matrix indexed by (firstcha, secondchan, trialidx, winidx,
  lagidx) containing the computed values of FOO.

If an acceptance filter was used, cells of FOOtrials that were not accepted
contain NaN.
