A phase-filtering parameter structure has the following fields:

"phasetargetdeg" is the target (dest - src) phase difference in degrees.

"acceptwidthdeg" is the phase difference acceptance window width in degrees.

"minplv" is the minimum phase-lock value required for acceptance. Phase lock
  value is (1 - circular variance). A value of 0 has no phase-locking and a
  value of 1 is perfectly phase-locked.
