A time window and time lag range specification describes the domain over
which analyses such as cross-correlation and transfer entropy are performed.
It is a structure with the following fields:


"time_window_ms" is the duration in milliseconds of the time windows used
  for extracting statistics.

"timelist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the analysis time windows should be.


"delay_range_ms" [ min max ] is the range of values in milliseconds to use
  for time lag when performing cross-correlation or similar calculations.

"delay_step_ms" is the distance between adjacent delay values tested. This
  is rounded to the nearest whole number of samples; specifying zero is a
  convenient way to get a delay step of one sample.
