A time window and time lag analysis performed via euInfo_doTimeAndLagAnalysis
requires two function handles: One that performes the analysis, and another
that discriminates between accepted and rejected trials and time windows.



An analysis function handle has the form:

result = analysisfunc( wavedest, wavesrc, samprate, delaylist, params )


"wavedest" is a 1 x Nsamples vector or a Ntrials x Nsamples matrix with
  windowed waveform data from the putative destination dataset.
"wavesrc" is a 1 x Nsamples vector or a Ntrials x Nsamples matrix with
  windowed waveform data from the putative source dataset.
"samprate" is the sampling rate.
"delaylist" is a vector containing time lags to be tested, in samples.
"params" is a structure containing user-supplied configuration parameters.

"result" is a structure with one or more fields. Each field contains a
  vector of the same length as "delaysamps" with analysis result values.
  These are used to produce result matrices per TIMEWINLAGDATA.txt.

As a special case, passing empty (0x0) matrices as "wavedest" or "wavesrc"
or "delaylist" returns a result structure containing empty vectors in all
data fields. This may be used to get a list of the fields that are provided.



An acceptance filter function handle has the following form:

acceptflag = filterfunc( wavedest, wavesrc, samprate, params )

"wavedest" is a vector with windowed waveform data from the putative
  destination dataset.
"wavesrc" is a vector with windowed waveform data from the putative source
  dataset.
"samprate" is the sampling rate.
"params" is a structure containing user-supplied configuration parameters.

"acceptflag" is true if the pair of waveforms is accepted and false otherwise.
