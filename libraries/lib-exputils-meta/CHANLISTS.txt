Bad channel lists, and other lists such as channels-of-interest, are stored
as hierarchical structures with the format described below.


A top-level channel list is a structure indexed by session label, containing
session channel lists.

A session channel list is a structure indexed by probe label, containing
cell arrays with channel labels.


Example:

badchanlist = struct();
badchanlist.('Session1') = struct();
badchanlist.('Session1').('Probe1') = { 'CH_005', 'CH_008' };


FIXME - Support the option of the top-level list or per-session lists
being cell arrays. The cleanest way to do this is probably to make a query
function that takes session and probe as the argument and returns a cell
array.
