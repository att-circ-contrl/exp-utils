A probe definition structure defines a group of channels (usually
corresponding to a probe). It has the following fields:


"label" is a plot-, filename-, and fieldname-safe label for this group.

"title" is a plot-safe human-readable name for this group.

"channums" is a vector with channel numbers for this group (corresponding
  to Louie and Charlie's spreadsheets; usually mapped rather than raw).

"chanlabels" is a cell array with Field Trip channel labels for this group.



(This is the end of the file.)
