The euMeta_getDesiredSessions_xx functions return struct arrays containing
metadata about sessions and probe channels that are to be processed.


Fields common to all types of experiment:

"monkey" is the name of the monkey being recorded.

"probedefs" is a struct array defining grouups of channels (usually
  corresponding to probes), with the following fields:
  "label" is a plot-, filename-, and fieldname-safe label for this group.
  "title" is a plot-safe human-readable name for this group.
  "channums" is a vector with channel numbers for this group (corresponding
    to Louie and Charlie's spreadsheets; usually mapped).
  "chanlabels" is a cell array with Field Trip channel labels for this
    group.



Fields for experiments that use Louie's metadata format:

"dataset" is a character vector with the value of the "dataset" field in
  Louie's metadata. This is also the top-level folder name for the session.



(This is the end of the file.)
