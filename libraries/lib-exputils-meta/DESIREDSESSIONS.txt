The euMeta_getDesiredSessions_xx functions return struct arrays containing
metadata about sessions and probe channels that are to be processed.


Fields common to all types of experiment:

"monkey" is the name of the monkey being recorded.

"probedefs" is a struct array defining groups of channels (usually
  corresponding to probes), with fields per PROBEDEFS.txt.



Fields for experiments that use Louie's metadata format:

"dataset" is a character vector with the value of the "dataset" field in
  Louie's metadata. This is also the top-level folder name for the session.



(This is the end of the file.)
