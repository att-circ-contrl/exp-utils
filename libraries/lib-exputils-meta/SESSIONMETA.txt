A session metadata list is a struct array containing individual records
with metadata about sessions.


Fields common to all types of experiment:

"folders_openephys" is a cell array of Open Ephys data folder names.
"folders_intanrec" is a cell array of Intan recording controller folders.
"folders_intanstim" is a cell array of Intan stim controller folders.
"folders_game" is a cell array of game data folder names.



Fields for experiments that use Louie's metadata format:

"logdata" is a record structure from Louie's log file.



Fields added by euMeta_pruneXXSessionList():

"monkey" is the name of the monkey being recorded.
"sessionid" is a unique character vector identifying the session. For
  Louie's data, this is a copy of "logdata.dataset", which contains the
  top-level folder name.
"sessionlabel" is a plot-, filename-, and fieldname-safe version of
  "sessionid".
"sessiontitle" is a plot-safe version of "sessionid".
"probedefs" is a struct array defining channel groups, per PROBEDEFS.txt.
