A trial metadata list is a struct array containing individual records with
metadata about trials.


Fields produced by euMeta_getTrialMetadataFromCodes():

"wasrewarded" indicates whether the 'Rewarded' or 'Unrewarded' code was seen.
"wascorrect" indicates 'CorrectResponse' vs 'IncorrectResponse'.
"tokensadded" is the data value from the 'TokensAdded' code, or NaN if none.

"rewardtime" is the timestamp of the 'Rewarded'/'Unrewarded' code.
"correcttime" is the timestamp of 'CorrectResponse'/'IncorrectResponse'.
"tokentime" is the timestamp of 'TokensAdded', or NaN if no code was seen.

"fixationlist" is a possibly-empty struct array with one record per
  fixation event. Each record has the following fields:
  "starttime" is the timestamp of the 'Fix(xxx)Start' code.
  "endtime" is the timestamp of the 'FixObjectEnd' code.
  "type" is the 'Fix(xxx)Start' code label that initiated the fixation.

"lastfixationstart" is the last "starttime" value in this list, or NaN if none.
"lastfixationend" is the last "endtime" value in this list, or NaN if none.
"lastfixationtype" is the last "type" value in this list, or '' if none.

"blockCode" is the block code value (from BlockDef.txt); this is also the
  block condition value from BlockData.txt.
"difficulty" is an integer reflecting task complexity. For FLToken, this is
  the 'Dimensionality' code value.


Fields associated with the FLToken dataset:

"gainTokens" (positive) is the number of tokens added for correct choices.
"lossTokens" (negative) is the number of tokens removed for incorrect.


Fields added by euMeta_addFrameDataToTrialMetadata():

"block_number" is the block number.
