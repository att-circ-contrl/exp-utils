# Chris's Experiment Utilities

## Overview

This is a set of libraries and utilities written to support ephys experiment
analyses in Thilo's lab.

This is intended to be a private project for lab-specific code; code that
lends itself to reuse can be migrated to public projects.


## Libraries

Libraries are provided in the `libraries` directory. With that directory
on path, call the `addPathsExpUtilsCjt` function to add sub-folders.

The following subdirectories contain library code:

* `lib-evcodes` --
Time-alignment and event code parsing.


## Sample Code

Sample code project folders are as follows:

* `ft-test` --
Test scripts, sample code, and documentation for using Field Trip with our
lab's datasets.


*This is the end of the file.*
