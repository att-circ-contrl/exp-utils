# Chris's Experiment Utilities

## Overview

This is a set of libraries and utilities written to support ephys experiment
analyses in Thilo's lab.

This is intended to be a private project for lab-specific code; code that
lends itself to reuse can be migrated to public projects.


## Libraries

The following directories contain library code:

* lib-evcodes --
Time-alignment and event code parsing.


## Sample Code

(FIXME -- Turn my test scripts into sample code.)


This is the end of the file.
