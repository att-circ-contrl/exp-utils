# Chris's experiment utilities bug list and feature request list.


## To-do list:

* Port the impedance plotting tools from
`exp-2021-silicon/analysis-202111025-nnex` to this project as its own tool.

* (Eventually) Move the sanity tool (and maybe impedance tool) to LoopUtil.

* Have the sanity tool look at impedance data to help classify channels.

* Have the sanity tool auto-tune its parameters based on pre-tagged channels.


## Bug list:

* Something's wonky with TTL bank indices in 'loop2302' config files.
Kludged it for now, but knowing what's actually going on would help.
See private notes for details.


_This is the end of the file._
